/**
 * Trigger a GitHub repository sync for the signed-in user (#690).
 *
 * This is the most expensive authenticated endpoint in the application —
 * `syncUserRepositories` walks the caller's GitHub App installation, runs
 * `partitionByOwnership`, and upserts in chunks with `REPO_SYNC_CONCURRENCY` in
 * flight — and it was the only route under `src/app/api/` with no rate limit at
 * all. Every sibling is wrapped: `/api/og/heist`,
 * `/api/findings/[id]/explain-stream`, `/api/heist-transmission`,
 * `/api/leaderboard`. Authentication bounds *who* can call this, not how often,
 * and a signed-in user holding down a retry loop turns it into sustained
 * consumption of the installation's shared GitHub API budget plus a write storm
 * against Postgres.
 *
 * It also returned `error?.message` straight to the caller. Those messages come
 * from Octokit, from the `App` constructor reading `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, or
 * from Prisma, and they carry request URLs with tokens in them, PEM parse
 * failures quoting the key material, and connection targets. This repository
 * already has `scrubSensitiveData` for exactly that, and this route used
 * neither it nor `withErrorHandler`.
 *
 * The `repositoryId` branch used to fabricate its result (#749): 4500 hardcoded
 * file paths, counted in a loop whose body was `totalSyncedFiles++`, answered
 * with `success: true, status: "COMPLETED", synchronizedFilesCount: 4500`. It
 * performed no query, no GitHub call and no write, it never validated or
 * ownership-checked the id it was given, and because it was entered on
 * truthiness it shadowed the real sync below for every request that named a
 * repository. It now resolves the repository against the caller and runs the
 * real sync, or says why it could not.
